# HaQ

The Game where everyone is a Hacker, where everyone invest their money to become a better one. The society of HaQ knows that the money they put asside are predestinated to be stolen but they earned them illegal anyway.. some by hacking other Hackers taking their money, some found in suspicious briefcases on the street. But the Hackers are people that know how to protect their investments one will say, well offcorse.. they see someone is hacking them but they don't actually know who he is.. so they try to guess and if the guess is right then the failed Hacker must pay the price.
- Hacking can be done only if both Targets are 30 metres one from another.
- Hacking takes 5 minutes, with 4 total rounds. Each round lasts 30 seconds. And 30 seconds break after it.
- To Hack, one must tap repeatedly the whole round, this making him visible to the other. And the other hacker have a single guess in that round.
